Selection of eigenvalue: 

In this experiment, I have checked errors for eigenvalues ranging from 20 to 100. 
Minimum error is obtained is 0.06%. This error can be achieved for more than one eigenvalues.
The minimum eigenvalue for which minimum error is achieved is 79. Between the range of eigenvalue
 79 to 89 maximum number of time (five times), minimum error is achieved.
